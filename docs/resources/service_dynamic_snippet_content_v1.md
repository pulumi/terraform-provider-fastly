# fastly_service_dynamic_snippet_content_v1

Defines content that represents blocks of VCL logic that is inserted into your service.  This resource will populate the content of a dynamic snippet and allow it to be manged without the creation of a new service verison.

~> **Warning:** This provider will take precedence over any changes you make through the API. Such changes are likely to be reversed if you run the provider again.

If this provider is being used to populate the initial content of a dynamic snippet which you intend to manage via the API, then the lifecycle `ignore_changes` field can be used with the resource.  An example of this configuration is provided below.


## Example Usage

### Basic usage:

```hcl 
resource "fastly_service_v1" "myservice" {
  name = "snippet_test"

  domain {
    name    = "snippet.fastlytestdomain.com"
    comment = "snippet test"
  }

  backend {
    address = "tftesting.tftesting.net.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
    name    = "AWS S3 hosting"
    port    = 80
  }

  dynamicsnippet {
    name     = "My Dynamic Snippet"
    type     = "recv"
    priority = 110
  }

  default_host = "tftesting.tftesting.net.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com"

  force_destroy = true
}

resource "fastly_service_dynamic_snippet_content_v1" "my_dyn_content" {
  for_each = {
    for d in fastly_service_v1.myservice.dynamicsnippet : d.name => d if d.name == "My Dynamic Snippet"
  }
  service_id = fastly_service_v1.myservice.id
  snippet_id = each.value.snippet_id

  content = "if ( req.url ) {\n set req.http.my-snippet-test-header = \"true\";\n}"

}
```

### Multiple dynamic snippets:

```hcl
resource "fastly_service_v1" "myservice" {
  name = "snippet_test"

  domain {
    name    = "snippet.fastlytestdomain.com"
    comment = "snippet test"
  }

  backend {
    address = "tftesting.tftesting.net.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com"
    name    = "AWS S3 hosting"
    port    = 80
  }

  dynamicsnippet {
    name     = "My Dynamic Snippet One"
    type     = "recv"
    priority = 110
  }

  dynamicsnippet {
       name     = "My Dynamic Snippet Two"
       type     = "recv"
       priority = 110
     }

  default_host = "tftesting.tftesting.net.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com"

  force_destroy = true
}

resource "fastly_service_dynamic_snippet_content_v1" "my_dyn_content_one" {
  for_each = {
    for d in fastly_service_v1.myservice.dynamicsnippet : d.name => d if d.name == "My Dynamic Snippet One"
  }

  service_id = fastly_service_v1.myservice.id
  snippet_id = each.value.snippet_id

  content = "if ( req.url ) {\n set req.http.my-snippet-test-header-one = \"true\";\n}"

}

resource "fastly_service_dynamic_snippet_content_v1" "my_dyn_content_two" {
  for_each = {
    for d in fastly_service_v1.myservice.dynamicsnippet : d.name => d if d.name == "My Dynamic Snippet Two"
  }

  service_id = fastly_service_v1.myservice.id
  snippet_id = each.value.snippet_id

  content = "if ( req.url ) {\n set req.http.my-snippet-test-header-two = \"true\";\n}"

}
```

### Supporting API dynamic snippet updates with ignore_changes

The following example demonstrates how the lifecycle `ignore_changes` field can be used to suppress updates against the
content in a dynamic snippet.  If, after your first deploy, the Fastly API is to be used to manage items in a dynamic snippet, then this will stop this provider realigning the remote state with the initial content defined in your HCL.

```hcl
...

resource "fastly_service_dynamic_snippet_content_v1" "my_dyn_content" {
  for_each = {
    for d in fastly_service_v1.myservice.dynamicsnippet : d.name => d if d.name == "My Dynamic Snippet"
  }
  service_id = fastly_service_v1.myservice.id
  snippet_id = each.value.snippet_id

  content = "if ( req.url ) {\n set req.http.my-snippet-test-header = \"true\";\n}"

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [content, ]
  }
}
```

## Import

This is an example of the import command being applied to the resource named `fastly_service_dynamic_snippet_content_v1.content`
The resource ID is a combined value of the `service_id` and `snippet_id` separated by a forward slash.

```
$ terraform import fastly_service_dynamic_snippet_content_v1.content xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx/xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```
